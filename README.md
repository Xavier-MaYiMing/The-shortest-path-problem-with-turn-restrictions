### The Shortest Path Problem with Time Windows



##### The shortest path problem with turn restrictions (SPPTR) aims to find the shortest path on a network with turn restrictions. Five different algorithms and the 0-1 programming model for the SPPTR.

#### Example

![](https://github.com/Xavier-MaYiMing/The-labeling-algorithms-for-the-shortest-path-problem-with-turn-restrictions/blob/main/SPPTR%20example.png)

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_network = {
        0: {2: 1},
        1: {2: 1},
        2: {0: 1, 1: 1, 3: 2, 5: 1},
        3: {4: 1},
        4: {5: 2},
        5: {2: 1},
    }
    tr = [[0, 2, 5]]
    print(main(test_network, 0, 5, tr))
```

##### Output (labeling_v1):

```python
({'path': [0, 2, 1, 2, 5], 'length': 4}, 8, 7)
```

##### Output (labeling_v2):

```python
({'path': [0, 2, 1, 2, 5], 'length': 4}, 6, 6)
```

The results indicate that labeling_v2 is more efficient than labeling_v1, as it adds and extracts less labels from the priority queue.
